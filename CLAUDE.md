# CLAUDE.md — Foundation Skills

## Project Overview

Foundation Skills is a centralized repository of AI agent skills for Dedalus ERP-PAS development teams. Skills are Markdown-based instructions (SKILL.md files) that AI agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) load dynamically to perform specialized tasks reproducibly. The project follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard.

## Tech Stack

- **Format:** Markdown (SKILL.md), Agent Skills standard

## Key Directories

- `skills/` — Contains 40 skill directories, each with a `SKILL.md` file defining the skill's instructions
- `docs/` — Contains documentation files: one per skill plus general guides (healthcare parsers, installation, etc.)

## Skill Categories

1. **Development skills:** coding-standards, backend-patterns, react-best-practices, vue-best-practices, frontend, web-design-guidelines, create-design-system-rules, mcp-builder, playwright-skill, postgres, security-review, tdd, testing-patterns, typescript-migration, git-guardrails, write-a-skill
2. **Healthcare & legacy:** hpk-parser, hl7-pam-parser, hexagone-frontend, hexagone-swdoc, uniface-procscript, fides-ace-spec
3. **Issue/review management:** code-review, issue-review, gitlab-issue, github-issues, triage-issue
4. **Document processing:** docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx, article-extractor
5. **Collaboration:** meeting, fast-meeting, grill-me, ubiquitous-language
6. **Utilities:** changelog-generator, docs

## Conventions

- Each skill lives in its own directory under `skills/`
- The main instruction file is always named `SKILL.md`
- Every SKILL.md must have YAML frontmatter with at least `name`, `description`, and `version` fields
- `version` is at the root level of the frontmatter (not nested under `metadata`)
- Reference materials go in a `reference/` subdirectory
- Documentation in `docs/` mirrors skill names (e.g., `skills/postgres/` → `docs/postgres.md`)
- README and docs are written in French
- SKILL.md files are written in English (they are instructions for AI agents)

## Versioning

- Each skill has its own semver `version` field in its SKILL.md frontmatter
- **Bump rules:** when a PR modifies a SKILL.md, bump that skill's version:
  - `patch` (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): typo fixes, wording improvements, minor clarifications
  - `minor` (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): new features, new sections, meaningful behavior changes
  - `major` (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): breaking changes (renamed skill, removed features, restructured workflow)
- The repo is also tagged at the repo level (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.) for consumers who install the full bundle

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Install skills in a project
npx skills add Dedalus-ERP-PAS/foundation-skills -g -y
```

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Remote: `https://github.com/Dedalus-ERP-PAS/foundation-skills.git`
- Commit messages: conventional commits style (`feat(scope): description`)

## Patterns to Follow

- When adding a new skill: create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `docs/<name>.md`
- Update the skills table in `README.md` when adding/removing skills
- Keep SKILL.md files focused on actionable instructions for AI agents
- Documentation files in `docs/` should be concise guides explaining the skill's purpose and usage
